  description: "Welcome to the SCP Foundation, researcher.\r\n\r\nIt has likely been
    a difficult journey to find yourself where you are today, having to be scouted
    out by people you've never met before and invited to exams and interviews for
    a position you were never fully told of. We can imagine you already have a few
    questions, whether it be where you are, who is here with you, or why you were
    chosen to be here. Many of these questions we will not be able to answer. Some
    of those, we will.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation has a very clear policy: \"Secure, Contain,
    Protect. Not Destroy, Destroy, Destroy.\" We are NOT the Global Occult Coalition.\n\nCurrently
